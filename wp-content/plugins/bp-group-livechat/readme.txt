Basic live chat within groups.

The Live Chat area provides an ajax chat room which displays the most recent messages along with timestamps and usernames.  It also has a "who's online" area which shows other group members viewing the Live Chat page.  "Super Admins" can spy on the chats of all groups.

This plugin is extremely basic and has no promises of support.
